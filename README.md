Harmony was an idea that was formed in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis. We wanted to figure out how people could make music together while they are apart. Harmony is an application where you can join friends and create music with consistent playback.  

Key Features

How To Use

When you open the sight you will notice several grids. Feel free to play around with these as much as you want, but the real fun starts when you get other people involved. Create an account and then create a room. Once you enter a room you will be able to select an instrument and start jamming! To play with others, have them join the room with the name you used. Use the Play All button to play all of the notes that everyone has written on their instruments.
