Harmony was an idea that was formed in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis. We wanted to figure out how people could make music together while they are apart. Harmony is an application where you can join friends and create music with consistent playback.  

Key Features
* Create musical compositions solo or with friends using up to 4 instruments (bass, piano, keyboard, and drums)
  - display musical compositions with an appealing UI/UX design that updates real-time across multiple platforms
  - play, pause, or playback musical compositions
* Secure authentication for user signup/login
* Room Features: users can create, destroy, and join rooms where they can make music
* Chatting: users can chat with other users that are in the same room

[How To Use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPL3O47iZsg)

When you open the sight you will notice several grids. Feel free to play around with these as much as you want, but the real fun starts when you get other people involved. Create an account so you can then create a room. When creating a room you will need to type a name and select how many beats you want to have. Once you enter a room you will be prompted to select an instrument and then you can start jamming! To play with others, have them join the room with the name you used. Use the Play All button to play all of the notes that everyone has written on their instruments.
